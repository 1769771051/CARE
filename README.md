# CARE

CARE is a prototype tool for automatically updating and reusing existing test cases when facing regulation changes. It is the official implementation for paper "[CARE: Cascading Impact-Aware Compliance Test Suite Evolution under Regulatory Changes]()". In response to frequent changes in regulatory rules, this paper proposes CARE, a cascading impact-aware framework for automated compliance testing evolution. Existing approaches often suffer from over-reuse or missed updates because they treat rule changes in isolation and ignore complex interdependencies across testing artifacts. CARE addresses this issue by constructing a unified four-layer cascading relation model spanning Rule-Requirement-Scenario-Test Case, enabling fine-grained traceability across abstraction levels. By explicitly modeling how rule changes propagate and amplify along this chain, the framework precisely identifies impacted scenarios and test cases that need updating, while safely maximizing the reuse of unaffected ones.

Experiments conducted on real-world compliance testing tasks across multiple domains show that CARE achieves an average F1 of 90.3\% on updated test suites, outperforming existing methods by up to 164\% and approaching expert-level effectiveness. Ablation studies further demonstrate that explicit cascading impact modeling and handling are key contributors to these improvements. In addition, CARE substantially reduces manual effort and improves test maintenance efficiency, and indicates strong cross-domain generalization. This work highlights cascading impact propagation as a central challenge in regulation-driven test maintenance and shows that shifting from isolated rule handling to cascading impact-aware evolution is essential for achieving both high test quality and maintenance efficiency.

## 1 Evaluation Datasets and Prompts

### 1.1 Evaluation Datasets

The evaluation dataset is located in [data/evaluation_dataset/](./data/evaluation_dataset/) and contains benchmark data for experimental evaluation. The dataset is organized into four subdirectories:

| Directory | Description | Format |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| [ini_rule/](./data/evaluation_dataset/ini_rule/) | Initial regulation documents before changes | PDF / TXT |
| [upd_rule/](./data/evaluation_dataset/upd_rule/) | Updated regulation documents after regulatory changes | PDF / TXT |
| [ini_testcase/](./data/evaluation_dataset/ini_testcase/) | Initial test case base corresponding to initial rules | JSON |
| [upd_testcase/](./data/evaluation_dataset/upd_testcase/) | Ground truth updated test cases after rule changes | JSON |

The dataset includes 11 datasets covering various financial regulatory domains such as Finance (Dataset 1-6), Automotive (Dataset 7-9), and Power (Dataset 10-11).

### 1.2 Prompts

The prompts are located in [data/prompt/](./data/prompt/) and are designed for LLM-based test case generation and evolution.

#### 1.2.1 Structured Requirement Generation

**File**: [structed_requirement_generation.txt](./data/prompt/structed_requirement_generation.txt)

This prompt is designed to transform natural language financial business rules into a structured format. Key features include:

- **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Process**: Guides the LLM through element extraction, label assignment, requirement construction, and self-reflection
- **If-Then Rule Format**: Converts complex natural language rules into machine-interpretable `if condition then consequence` format
- **Predefined Label Set**: Provides a standardized tag system (Operator, Action, Target, Product, Method, Time, Quantity, Price, State, Event, etc.)
- **Flexible Tag Extension**: Supports domain-specific tag extension when predefined tags are insufficient
- **Multi-rule Decomposition**: Handles parallel conditions and nested logic by splitting into independent rules

#### 1.2.2 End-to-End Test Case Generation

**File**: [e2e_test_case_generation.txt](./data/prompt/e2e_test_case_generation.txt)

This prompt is designed for intelligently updating and reusing existing test case repositories when financial business requirements change. Key features include:

- **Change Identification**: Analyzes differences between original and new requirements to identify added, modified, or deleted rules
- **Cascading Impact Analysis**: Considers potential cascading impacts across related rules and test cases
- **Test Case Reuse**: Preserves test cases for unchanged rules to maximize asset reuse
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Generates test cases covering positive scenarios, negative scenarios, and boundary conditions
- **Format Consistency**: Ensures output follows the input JSON structure for compatibility with existing test frameworks




## 2 Installation

### 2.1 Install step-by-step

All scripts are designed for and run on ***Ubuntu 22.04***.

1. Install dependencies.

    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt upgrade -y
    sudo apt install build-essential zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libncurses5-dev libgdbm-dev libnss3-dev libssl-dev libreadline-dev libffi-dev
    sudo apt-get install -y libgl1-mesa-dev
    sudo apt-get install libglib2.0-dev
    sudo apt install wget
    sudo apt install git
    ```

2. Install miniconda.

    ```bash
    cd ~
    wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
    bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
    source ~/.bashrc
    ```

3. Create a virtual python environment and install all the required dependencies.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/1769771051/CARE.git
    cd CARE
    conda create -n CARE python=3.9
    conda activate CARE
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    # Install flash-attention based on your CUDA version. For example:
    wget https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention/releases/download/v2.5.6/flash_attn-2.5.6+cu118torch2.0cxx11abiFALSE-cp39-cp39-linux_x86_64.whl
    pip install flash_attn-2.5.6+cu118torch2.0cxx11abiFALSE-cp39-cp39-linux_x86_64.whl
    
    pip install -e .
    ```

4. Download / Config the used LLMs.
    We offer two ways to use LLM: calling a commercial LLM API or fine-tuning an LLM locally.

    **Option 1: Calling a commercial LLM API**
    To use a commercial LLM API, you need to obtain an API key from the provider. Then, put the API key in **api_key.json**.

    ```json
    {
        "baseURL": "...",
        "apiKey": "...",
        "model": "..."
    }
    ```

    **Option 2: Fine-tuning an LLM locally**
    To fine-tune an LLM locally, you need to download the pretrained model from HuggingFace.

    ```bash
    mkdir model
    mkdir model/pretrained
    mkdir model/trained
    git lfs install
    git clone https://huggingface.co/a1769771051/CARE
    cp -r CARE/* model/trained/
    rm -rf CARE

    cd model/pretrained
    git clone https://huggingface.co/THUDM/glm-4-9b-chat
    git clone https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-8B
    cd ../..
    ```

5. Run a test demo.
    ```bash
    cd reuse
    python update_testcase.py
    ```
This step prefer API calls. If parameters like apikey are not filled in, the fine-tuned LLM will be used instead. After the command finishes running, the updated test cases are saved at **cache/new_testcase.json**.



## 3 Usage
We provide a streamlined interface, using commands to generate updated test cases for the updated document based on the initial document and initial test cases:

```bash
cd ours
python update_testcase.py --old_file {old_file} --old_testcases {old_testcases} --new_file {new_file} --new_testcases {new_testcases}
```

where {*old_file*} is the path of the initial regulation document, {*old_testcases*} is the path of the initial test case base, {*new_file*} is the path of the updated regulation document, and {*new_testcases*} is the file to save the output updated test cases.
